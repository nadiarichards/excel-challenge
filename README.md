1.    Given the provided data, what are three conclusions we can draw about Kickstarter campaigns?
a.    53% of Kickstarter campaigns are successful, 37% fail and 8.5% are cancelled. 74% of Kistarter campaigns are launched in the US.
b.    Theater is the most successful category with “Plays” being the most successful sub-category covering 37% of total successful campaigns.
c.    Most successful campaigns launched in Feb, May and June.

2.    What are some limitations of this dataset?
a.    There is no information on the specific backers who contributed the most to the campaigns. Could be useful to be able to offer the campaigns in specific categories to those backers who contributed to that category the most in the past to secure more funding faster.
b.    May be useful to convert the funds into one currency (USD since 74% of the campaigns are in the US) to dig deeper into correlations between funding and categories and so forth.

3.    What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
a.    Which categories and sub-categories received the most funding / what is the percentage of the goal campaigns received by category.
b.    We could create a pivot table comparing the amounts contributed to the campaigns by country and currency and see which categories are the most successful in different countries.
c.    Filter and format data to show the categories with largest average donation and biggest amount of backers to point out categories that are easiest to fund.
d.    To compare the length of time each campaign was running for and amount of capital secured, as well as the impact of time between the creation and the end of the campaign on its success.
e.    Create a pivot chart showing the connection between % of goal reached and if the campaign received the spotlight or not.
